  Welcome to The Shades' secure database access portal—well, it was secure until now. 
  An anonymous informant has leaked a tool for accessing a Noxhaven SQL database. 
  It's said this portal was used by the megacorp Nexus before The Fall. With the 
  right touch, you can even share your discoveries with others in the network...or exploit 
  a vulnerability lurking beneath its code. Are you skilled enough to leave your mark 
  on Nexus's own systems?  
hints:
  - Rumor has it that the data stored here holds clues to Nexus's downfall. But it's 
      just a query interface—or is it? (Penalty - 15)
  - They say this portal can only run queries, but with the right syntax, you might 
      be able to slip in some code of your own. (Penalty - 15)
