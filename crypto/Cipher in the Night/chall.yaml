  In the heart of Noxhaven, secrets are buried beneath layers of digital 
  encryption. The Shadows have intercepted a message, `enc.txt`, but it's locked 
  away with a simple keyâ€”one that hides in plain sight. Your task is to 
  unravel the hidden truth encoded in the XOR cipher, revealing what the 
  corrupt megacorporations have been trying to conceal. Can you decipher the 
  enigma before the shadows close in?
