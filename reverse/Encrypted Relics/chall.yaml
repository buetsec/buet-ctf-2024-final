description: |-
  In the hidden archives of Noxhaven, whispers tell of an ancient 
  method dubbed "pickling", that developers seemed to like. It's used to lock away valuable 
  code relics from prying eyes, masking their true purpose. The Shades 
  suspect that a fragment containing traces of 
  pre-Fall tech lies withinâ€”but it won't reveal itself easily. 
  Are you savvy enough to decode it?
